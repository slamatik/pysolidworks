I'm trying to write a wrapper for SolidWorks API using python. Currently I'm facing a problem in a situations where I need to pass Object to a software. 
I have existing code that works fine in VBA

    Dim swApp           As SldWorks.SldWorks
    Dim swModel         As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
    Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
    Set swModel = swApp.OpenDoc6(Path & swFileName, swDocDRAWING, swOpenDocOptions_Silent, "", nErrors, nWarnings)
    Set swExportPDFData = swApp.GetExportFileData(1)
    swModel.Extension.SaveAs endPath, 0, 0, swExportPDFData, nErrors, nWarnings

So I'm pretty much trying to replicate that but in python. But I think I'm having an issue with swExportPDFData which is an object of IExportPdfData Interface. 
Documentation says that swExportPDFData is

    IExportPdfData object for exporting drawing sheets to PDF

What I've tried so far

    sw = SldWorks()
    model = sw.open_doc(file)[0]
    efd = sw.get_export_file_data() # instance of IExportPdfData
    efd.view_pdf_after_saving = False
    model.extension.save_as(name='Test.png', versio=0, options=1, export_data=efd)

Code for save as function:

class IModelDocExtension
    def __init__(self, parent):
        self._instance = parent.Extension
